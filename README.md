## ðŸ“–Overview
**Caffeinated** is a vanilla-style mod for Fabric that adds a new crop found in jungles - coffee! Coffee berries are harvested from shrubs, and are then used to plant more coffee shrubs or brew coffee. Coffee itself provides a unique effect that will preserve your hunger overtime and reduce exhaustion from tasks such as mining or running.

Brewing coffee is greatly accessible in survival! All it takes is a campfire, your trusty cauldron, and - of course - some coffee. Pour water into a cauldron, heat it over a campfire, then add ground coffee; within seconds, you'll have a fresh batch of coffee ready to be bottled up. Coffee can be drunk straight from the bottle to inflict Caffeine for several minutes. Alternatively, you can make tiramisu, a new food that inflicts even stronger Caffeine for less time.
