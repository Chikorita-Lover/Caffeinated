# Caffeinated

**Caffeinated** is a vanilla-style mod for *Minecraft* Fabric that adds coffee, a new crop that can be turned into blocks and food!

Coffee shrubs are new plants that can be found in jungle biomes. When fully grown, their berries can be harvested, and used to make coffee beans to plant more, or ground coffee to brew coffee.

Coffee is brewed by adding ground coffee to a cauldron of water over a lit campfire. After just several moments, a fresh batch of coffee can be bottled up and drunk at any time.

Drinking coffee or eating tiramisu, a food item make with coffee, will give players Caffeine, a new effect that allows food points to last longer when doing activities like running, jumping, or mining.

## Compatibility
Caffeinated has several compatibility features when [Farmer's Delight](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric) is installed:
